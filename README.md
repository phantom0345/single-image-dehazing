# single-image-dehazing
This project uses a U-Net-based deep learning model for image dehazing, trained on just 1,000 hazy images mapped to 100 clear images from the RESIDE dataset. Despite the limited training, it achieves PSNR of 16.82 and SSIM of 0.625, combining transmission map prediction with postprocessing for enhanced clarity.
